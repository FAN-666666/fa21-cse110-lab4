Question 1:

3

Question 2:

150

Question 3:

150

Question 4:

The function will return a list of discounted price as integers, because the function calculate the discounted price of each input price, round them up, and then push them into a list container.

Question 5:

Error, because the previoud i is defined in the for-loop block, and the current i is not defined at its scope

Question 6:

Error, because the previoud discountedPrice is defined in the for-loop block, and the current discountedPrice is not defined at its scope

Question 7:

150, because finalPrice is assgined with the value of rounded discounted price in the for-loop block and finalPrice is defined at its scope.

Question 8:

The function will return a list of discounted price as integers, because the function calculate the discounted price of each input price, round them up, and then push them into a list container. The list discounted is correctly defined within its scope by a "let" keyword

Question 9:

Error, because the previoud i is defined in the for-loop block, and the current i is not defined at its scope

Question 10:

3, because the value of length equals to the length of input list which has length of 3.

Question 11:

The function will return a list of discounted price without rounding, because the function calculate the discounted price of each input price and then push them into a list container. Although discounted is a const variable, it still can be manipulated, becasue const varibale cannot be reassigned but can be manipulated 

Question 12:

A. student.name

B. student["Grad Year"]

C. student.greeting()

D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name

E. student.courseLoad[0]

Question 13:

A. "32", because integer 2 maps to its exact string representation. "3" + "2" = "32"

B. 1 because '3' is converted to integer 3. (3 - 2 = 1)

C. 3 because null's numerical value is 0. (3 + 0 = 3)

D. '3null' because null is converted to string "null".

E. 4 because the numerical value of true is 1. (1 + 3 = 4)

F. 0 because the numerical value of both false adn null is 0. (0 + 0 = 0)

G. '3undefined' becuase the string representation of undefined is "undefined"

H. NaN because the numerical value of undefined is NaN 

Question 14:

A. true. '2' becomes 2

B. false. '2' compares with the '1' in '12'. They become 2 and 1. 2 > 1

C. true. '2' becomes 2

D. false. === checks the equality without type conversion. '2' are 2 are different types.

E. false. true becomes 1

F. true. Boolean(2) returns true if the input number is not 0.

Question 15:

== compares the values of two variables ignoring their types, while === compares both the types and the values of two variables

Question 17:

The result will be [2,4,6]. Firstly, function modifyArray is directly called by 'modifyArray([1,2,3], doSomething)'. In function modifyArray, the function doSomething gets called three times in the for-loop, and the argument for calling doSomething is each number in [1,2,3]. The doSomething function doubles each argument number and returns back, and then the returned results get pushed into a list called newArray. In the end, function modifyArary returns the newArray variable.
